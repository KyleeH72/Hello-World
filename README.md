Hello-World
===========
Hi everyone, I'm just learning about Git and trying to get a better understanding for it! Hey, bear with me now. I know this isn't the most exciting repository you've ever seen. I'm new, but learning fast. Please feel free to give me pointers along the way :) I'm aiming to be the best go "gitter" I can be!
